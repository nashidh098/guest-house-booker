Build a Guest House Room Booking web application using Node.js with Express for backend and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for frontend. Use a simple database such as SQLite or MongoDB.

The application is for room booking.

Create a customer booking form with the following required fields:
Full Name
ID Card Number or Passport Number
Select Room Number (dropdown: Room 1, Room 2, Room 3, etc.)
Check-in Date (date picker)
Check-out Date (date picker)

Rooms must not be double-booked. If a room is already booked, other customers must not be able to book the same room for overlapping dates. When a user selects dates and room, check existing bookings in the database. If dates overlap, show a message “Room already booked for selected dates” and disable the submit button.

A booking conflicts if:
newCheckin < existingCheckout AND newCheckout > existingCheckin

Daily room rent is 600 MVR. Automatically calculate total nights, total amount in MVR, and total amount in USD when dates are selected. The USD exchange rate is fixed at 1 USD = 19.50 MVR.

Total nights = checkout date minus check-in date
Total MVR = total nights × 600
Total USD = total MVR ÷ 19.50

Display both MVR and USD clearly on the form.

Display bank transfer details clearly above the payment upload section. Each account number must have a copy-to-clipboard button and show “Account number copied” after copying.

Bank of Maldives
MVR Account: 7777777776666667
Account Name: W Collection
USD Account: 7777777776666666
Account Name: W Collection

Maldives Islamic Bank
MVR Account: 99999999888999889
Account Name: W Collection
USD Account: 999988887777888888
Account Name: W Collection

Allow users to upload a bank transfer slip image. Save the uploaded file on the server in an uploads folder and store the file name in the database.

On submission, validate all fields, confirm room availability, and save the booking in the database with status set to Pending. Prevent submission if the room is already booked.

After successful booking, automatically generate an invoice page that includes guest name, ID or passport number, room number, check-in date, check-out date, total nights, price per day, total amount in MVR, total amount in USD, and booking date.

Provide options to download the invoice as a PDF file and to share the invoice.

Create an admin dashboard where the admin can view all bookings, view uploaded payment slips, and see booking status (Pending or Confirmed). When a new booking is submitted, the admin must receive an immediate notification (console log or email is acceptable).

Use a clean, mobile-friendly design. Structure the project properly with Express backend, frontend public folder, uploads folder, database integration, and include clear instructions on how to run the project on Replit.
